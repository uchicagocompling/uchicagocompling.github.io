<!--
<i>I am indeed recruiting PhD students! Students can apply to work with me through the <a href="https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/graduate/admissions">Dept. of Linguistics</a> or the <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/admissions/graduate/">Dept. of Computer Science</a>.</i><br><br>
*************<br><br>
-->
I am a computational linguist, addressing research problems on <b>language in humans and machines</b>. I have training in linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), and cognitive neuroscience of language, which I use to bridge research in these domains.<br><br>
In my research I do a combination of NLP and computational psycholinguistic modeling. My cross-disciplinary training allows me to bring theoretical and analytical insights from linguistics and cognitive neuroscience to the development of NLP systems, and to bring computational tools and methods from NLP to the modeling of human language processing. <br><br>

<!--
In my research I <b>build and analyze computational models of language processing</b> for two purposes: to simulate and understand language processing in the brain (computational psycholinguistics), and to evaluate and improve language processing in NLP systems. My particular interest is in the <b>processing and representation of sentence meaning</b>.<br><br>

  <ul class="inside">
    <li>What are the interacting mechanisms and representations at work as the brain converts sentence inputs into meaningful interpretations in real time? </li>
    <li>How can we engineer systems that process and represent the meanings of sentence inputs as effectively as humans do?</li>
  </ul>

-->
I am committed to building closer connections between linguistics, NLP, and cognitive neuroscience of language so that advances in each can benefit the others.
To this end, I <a href="research.html">collaborate broadly</a> across these domains, teach <a href="teaching.html">interdisciplinary courses</a> for students in these fields, and have an active organizational role in interdisciplinary communities such as the
<a href=https://blogs.umass.edu/scil/ target="_blank">Society for Computation in Linguistics</a> and the <a href=http://generalizablenlp.weebly.com target="_blank">Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable NLP Systems</a> that bring together linguists and computer scientists.

<p class="bio">
I am an Assistant Professor in the University of Chicago <a href=https://linguistics.uchicago.edu target="_blank">Department of Linguistics</a> and <a href=https://cs.uchicago.edu target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>. Previously, I spent a year as a Research Assistant Professor at the <a href=http://www.ttic.edu target="_blank">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a>, and I have a courtesy affiliation with TTIC.<br><br>
I did my PhD work at the University of Maryland with <a href=http://www.colinphillips.net target="_blank">Colin Phillips</a> and <a href=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/ target="_blank">Philip Resnik</a>, in addition to collaborations with numerous faculty and students across the linguistics and computer science departments.
I was an active member of the <a href=https://languagescience.umd.edu target="_blank">Maryland Language Science Center</a>.<br><br>
Starting with a background in linguistics and cognitive neuroscience, I undertook a rapid computational conversion when I became fascinated by the problem of language processing in machines, and how this enterprise can connect with research on language in humans.<br><br>
Before joining the community at the University of Maryland, I spent two years conducting neurolinguistic MEG research with <a href=http://psych.nyu.edu/morphlab/people/alec.html>Alec Marantz</a> in the <a href=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/nellab/>Neuroscience of Language Lab</a> at NYU.<br><br>
I have lived in China twice, and am fluent in Mandarin. My second time in China consisted of a year of graduate-level study, in Mandarin, of topics in political science, law, and cultural studies at the <a href="https://sais.jhu.edu/hopkins-nanjing-center">Hopkins-Nanjing Center</a>.<br><br>

I graduated from Brandeis University in 2010 with bachelor's degrees in linguistics and psychology.<br><br>
<!--
I grew up in a small coastal town in the great state of Maine. I am a longtime soccer player and lover of theater and literature, and I have had the language bug since I first went abroad as a child.</p>
